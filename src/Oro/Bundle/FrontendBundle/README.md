# OroFrontendBundle

OroFrontendBundle enables the storefront for interacting with customers in Oro application. The storefront complements the management console UI that is available to the company employees only.

The bundle adapts Oro application functionality to work with the storefront, enables management console administrators to configure related settings in the system configuration UI and provides a style book for the frontend developers as the guidance for the storefront markup conventions.

See online [bundle documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/bundles/commerce/FrontendBundle/#bundle-docs-commerce-customer-portal-frontend-bundle) and [Frontend Developer Guide](https://doc.oroinc.com/frontend/) for more information on OroFrontendBundle and storefront customization and design.
