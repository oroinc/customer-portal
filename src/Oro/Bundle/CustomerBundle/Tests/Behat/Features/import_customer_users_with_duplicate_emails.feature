Feature: Import Customer Users with Duplicate Emails
  In order to add multiple customer users at once
  As an Administrator
  I want to be able to import customer users from a CSV file that may contain duplicate emails

  Scenario: Data Template for Customer Users
    Given I login as administrator
    And go to Customers/ Customer Users
    And number of records should be 1
    When I download "Customer Users" Data Template file

  Scenario: Import existing by ID Customer User update both rows to same email
    Given I fill template with data:
      | ID | First Name | Last Name | Email Address     | Customer Id | Customer Name | Roles 1 Role                | Website Id | Owner Id |
      | 1  | Test3      | Test3     | test2@example.org | 1           | Test          | ROLE_FRONTEND_ADMINISTRATOR | 1          | 1        |
