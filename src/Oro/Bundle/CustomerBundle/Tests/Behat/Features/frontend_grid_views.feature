Feature: Frontend Grid Views
  ToDo: BAP-16103 Add missing descriptions to the Behat features
  #Implement frontend grid views.
  #The functionality should work exactly like in the admin.
  #Also we should remember current grid state (filters, sorters, etc) for each page, and restore it when the user comes back to this page again.

  # Scenario: Preconditions
  # I should have:
  # grid View "All Users"
  # Users
  # First Name         Last Name       Email Address              Customer       Enabled   Confirmed
  # Amanda             Cole            AmandaRCole@example.org    Company A      yes       yes
  # FirstName_1        LastName_1      user_1@example.org         Company A      yes       yes
  # FirstName_2        LastName_2      user_2@example.org         Company A      yes       yes
  # FirstName_3        LastName_3      user_3@example.org         Company A      yes       yes

  Scenario: Create new grid view, checked that settings are saved, delete grid view
    Given I signed in as AmandaRCole@example.org on the store frontend
    And I click "Account"
    And I click "Users"
    When I hide all columns in "Customer Users Grid" except First Name, Last Name, Email Address
    When I filter Filter By First Name as contains "FirstName_3"
    When I click grid view list on "Customer Users Grid" grid
    And I click "Save As New"
    And I set "Test_View_1" as grid view name for "Customer Users Grid" grid on frontend
    And I mark Set as Default on grid view for "Customer Users Grid" grid on frontend
    And I click "FrontendGridAddViewButton"
    Then I should see "View has been successfully created" flash message
    And I reload the page
    Then I should see "Test_View_1"
    And I should see following grid:
      |First Name      |Last Name       |Email Address          |
      |FirstName_3     |LastName_3      |user_3@example.org     |
    And I shouldn't see "Enabled" column in grid
    And I shouldn't see "Confirmed" column in grid

    And I click grid view list on "Customer Users Grid" grid
    And I click "Delete"
    And I click "Yes, Delete"
    Then I should see "View has been successfully deleted" flash message
    When I click grid view list on "Customer Users Grid" grid
    Then I should not see "Test_View_1"
    And I click "Sign Out"
