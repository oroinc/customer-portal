Feature: Popup user menu
  In order to provide optimized user experience based on the customer user menu configuration
  As an Administrator
  I want to choose the template for the customer user menu

  # Description
  # Based on the setting selected in system configuration use one of the two tempaltes to display customer user menu:
  # all menu items are displayed on the page
  # menu items are displayed in a drop-down when user clicks on the user name
  # Use different welcome messages in the templates:
  # default template (all at once) - "John Doe"
  # when only name is shown - "Welcome, John Doe"
  #
  # Configuration
  # Add new fieldset "Menu Templates" to the System -> Configuration -> COMMERCE -> Design -> Theme page:
  # new field "User Menu" - drop-down, default value - "Show all items at once", hint - none, values:
  # Show all items at once
  # Show subitems in a popup
  # These settings should be configurable on the global, organization and website levels.
  #
  # Acceptance Criteria
  # Show how an administrator can change the template used for customer user menu
  # Show how the "popup" template works
