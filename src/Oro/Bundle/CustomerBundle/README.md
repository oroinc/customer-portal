# OroCustomerBundle

OroCustomerBundle enables B2B-customer-related features in Oro applications and provides UI to manage B2B customers, customers groups, customer users, and customer user roles in the back-office and the storefront UI.

The bundle also allows back-office administrators to configure B2B-customer-related settings in the system configuration UI for the entire system, individual organizations, and websites.

Please see [online documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/master/backend/bundles/commerce/CustomerBundle/) for more information.
