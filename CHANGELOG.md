## UNRELEASED

### Changed
#### FrontendBundle

The 'data-dom-relocation' selector to specify options for `dom-relocation-view` was removed, use 'data-dom-relocation-options' instead.   

The oro grid system was modernized and uses CSS grid under the hood.
- As a result, you need to update your `html`:

  **layout.twig**
    ```diff
    - <div class="grid">
    -   <div class="grid__row">
